  <h1>My Web Development Journey</h1>
  <p>Hey everyone, my name is Micheal currently in my second year at Illinois institute of technology.</p>
  <p> I am excited about this "Fundamentals of Web Development" course to gain first-hand knowledge on how to use HTML and JavaScript for creating websites.</p>
  <p> I can't wait to begin exploring all these HTML technologies.</p>
